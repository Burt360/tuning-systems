This repo contains my (brief) study of the history of tuning systems. In particular, it contains code to generate diagrams and audio recordings to demonstrate each system. The `mid` folder contains MIDI audio demonstrations as well but generated by a digital keyboard rather than Python, while the `mp3` folder contains the conversions from MIDI.
